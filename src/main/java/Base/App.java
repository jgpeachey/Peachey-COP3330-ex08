Write a program to evenly divide pizzas. Prompt for the number of people,
the number of pizzas, and the number of slices per pizza. Ensure that the
number of pieces comes out even. Display the number of pieces of pizza each
person should get. If there are leftovers, show the number of leftover pieces.

Example Output:
How many people? 8
How many pizzas do you have? 2
How many slices per pizza? 8
8 people with 2 pizzas (16 slices)
Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza.
There are 0 leftover pieces.

Challenges
*Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values.
Donâ€™t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
*Alter the output so it handles pluralization properly, for example:
"Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza." or "Each person gets 1 piece of pizza."
Handle the output for leftover pieces appropriately as well.
*Create a variant of the program that prompts for the number of people and
the number of pieces each person wants, and calculate how many full pizzas
you need to purchase.
